# **Amazing-Numbers**

## **Objectives**
The program process the user requests, like:
```
1. Welcome users;
2. Display the instructions;
3. Ask for a request;
4. If a user enters an empty request, print the instructions;
5. If the user enters zero, terminate the program;
6. If numbers are not natural, print the error message;
7. If an incorrect property is specified, print the error message and the list of available properties;
8. For one number, print the properties of the number;
9. For two numbers, print the properties of all numbers in the list;
10. For two numbers and two properties, print the list of numbers that contain the specified properties;
11. If a property is preceded by a minus, this property should not be present in a number;
12. If the user specifies mutually exclusive properties, abort the request and warn the user.
13. Once the request is processed, continue execution from step 3.
```
## Instructions
```
Supported requests:
- enter a natural number to know its properties;
- enter two natural numbers to obtain the properties of the list:
  * the first parameter represents a starting number;
  * the second parameter shows how many consecutive numbers are to be printed;
- two natural numbers and properties to search for;
- a property preceded by minus must not be present in numbers;
- separate the parameters with one space;
- enter 0 to exit.
```
